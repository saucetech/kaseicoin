#kaseicoin

The purpose of this project was to leverage blockchain technology to create a new cryptocurrency called KaseiCoin for the monetary system of a fictional colony on Mars. The KaseiCoin is a fungible ERC-20 compliant token. A crowdsale will be launched that will allow users to convert their money to KaseiCoin. The project contains the KaseiCoin.sol and KaseiCoinCrowdsale.sol files.
